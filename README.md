# Heart-Rate-Variability-from-the-video

STEPS:

- Recording a high resolution 50 secs video face under slightly different light conditions at resolution up to 1280 Ã— 720 pixels at 60 FPS
- Upload the video
- Perform the face detection and tracking using OpenCV
- Select forehead as Region of Interest (ROI) and display adjusted boundary box
- Calculate heart rate from the signals from ROI under both light conditions
- Calculate heart rate variability (HRV) from the video
